<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Vehicle</li><li>LNG Vehicle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The natural gas vehicles market comprises two primary types: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) vehicles. CNG vehicles use compressed gas stored in high-pressure tanks, making them suitable for city driving and shorter distances. They are often used in public transportation and light-duty applications. In contrast, LNG vehicles store natural gas in a liquid state, allowing for greater energy density and longer range, ideal for heavy-duty trucks and long-haul transportation. Both types contribute to reducing emissions and dependence on traditional fuels.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Power Steering Hose Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"High Pressure Hose"</li><li>"Low Pressure Hose"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Power Steering Hose market is divided into two primary types: high-pressure hoses and low-pressure hoses. High-pressure hoses are designed to withstand the intense pressure generated by the power steering system, typically connecting the pump to the steering gear. These hoses are crucial for efficient steering performance. Conversely, low-pressure hoses return fluid from the steering gear back to the reservoir, featuring a more flexible design to handle varying pressures. Both types are essential for the overall functioning and safety of power steering systems.</p></p>
